# 4x4 Matrix Keypad with Raspberry Pi Pico and Nokia 5110 Display  

<!-- Describe your project in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->  
My project is a 4x4 matrix keypad connected to a Raspberry Pi Pico and a Nokia 5110 LCD display. It functions like a numeric keypad, similar to a calculator, allowing input of numbers and basic operations like addition and subtraction. The output is displayed on the Nokia 5110 screen.  

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->  
The estimated cost for components is around $XX.XX, depending on availability.  

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
One challenge was likely managing trace routing in a compact grid while avoiding overlaps, especially in the central area where multiple connections converge. Using a grid-based approach and leveraging tools like autorouting or manual trace optimization helped streamline the process. Maintaining proper spacing and ensuring all connections were correctly assigned to the header would have been critical for functionality.
